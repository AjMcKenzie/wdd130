    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey everyone! I am from San Antoino, Texas, but I have lived in a lot of diffrent places (mainly in the USA).<br>One of the place that I have lived is Norway. I moved there when I was 11 going on 12 years old. I lived there for three years and learned Norwegian. No it's not due to military. I am majoring in computer science at BYUI, but I'm not sure what field to go into yet. I like the idea of Cybersecurity and being a white hat hacker. I got into programming in high school after I relized that you have to be a good at drawing to be an animator.

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in the Helsinki, Finland mission in the years 2019-2021. I learned the Finnish language and had some great experiences. One of my dreams when I graduate from college is to find a that I can work from home and that pays well. I then want to buy an RV and visit all the continental United States and vist all the National parks.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had some experiences with HTML in high school. So I know a lot of the basics, but I am looking forward to learning more.</p>
